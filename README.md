# Podcaster React version using Hooks API
This is the Podcaster APP implemented using ReactJS and it's (nowadays) new Hooks API.  
There's a Custom Hook (_userExternalData_) which aims to ease with _page_ components that need to load external data.  
Also, there are this same concept implemented with an HOC and a _render prop_ component to clearly compare each approach:
* /src/components/home-page.js
* /src/components/home-page-hoc.js
* /src/components/home-page-render-prop.js
